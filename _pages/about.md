I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the the Department of Cognitive and Psychological Sciences at Brown University working with [Serra Favila](https://sites.brown.edu/favila-lab/). I previously earned my Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Oregon, where I was co-advised by [Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/), [Ben Hutchinson](https://hulacon.uoregon.edu/), and [Brice Kuhl](https://kuhllab.com/). Before that, I was a postbacc research assistant at NYU-ECNU Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science at NYU Shanghai, working with [Sze Chai Kwok](http://www.kwoklab.org/).

My research aims to understand the complex mechanisms that support human memory.
<!--My research explores how our brains give rise to learning and memory. Specifically, my PhD research seeks to understand how the human brain processes and encodes the temporal context in which events occur, and how temporal context change and stability influence our memory, using behavioral, neural, and computational methods.-->
